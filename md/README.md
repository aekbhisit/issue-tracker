# `md/` – Supplemental Markdown Notes

Use this folder for markdown content that does not belong in `docs/` or `plan/` yet:

- **Brainstorms, meeting notes, phase observations, and quick proposals** tied to the Issue Collector Platform roadmap.
- **Experiment logs or “work-in-progress” documentation** that will eventually graduate into a formal `docs/` or `plan/` entry.
- **Notes that need to stay versioned with the codebase** but are not production-ready knowledge articles.

Keep filenames short, descriptive, and uppercase-hyphenated (e.g. `IC-3-INSPECT-BRAINSTORM.md`). When the content stabilizes, relocate or summarize it inside `docs/` or `plan/` and archive the original file if needed.

If you are unsure whether something belongs here, prefer `docs/` for product/technical content and `plan/` for phase strategy; reserve `md/` for the “in-between” pieces that help the team collaborate on the Issue Collector Platform roadmap.
